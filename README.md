Hello, and welcome to my PDX Code Guild repo!

This is a collection of projects that I completed as part of my coursework at PDX Code Guild. I am currently working on tidying this up so that it is easier to read and navigate. Please enjoy. Feel free to direct any questions to PeterDziuba@gmail.com.
